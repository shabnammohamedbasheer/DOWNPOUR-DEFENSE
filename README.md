The state of Kerala, situated in the southwestern part of India, is known for its diverse landscape and rich biodiversity. However, Kerala also faces the recurring challenge of floods during the monsoon season, which often lead to significant human and economic losses. To address this issue, it is essential to understand the historical rainfall patterns and their correlation with flood occurrences.

This project aims to analyze a comprehensive dataset spanning over a century, from 1901 to 2018, focusing on Kerala's monthly and annual rainfall. Additionally, it investigates the occurrence of floods within this timeframe. By examining these data points, we seek to identify patterns, trends, and potential predictors of floods in Kerala.

The dataset comprises monthly rainfall measurements in millimeters for each year, enabling us to assess the variability and intensity of precipitation throughout the monsoon season. Furthermore, the annual rainfall summaries provide insights into the overall climatic conditions and potential deviations from the long-term average.

A crucial aspect of this analysis is the binary indicator denoting flood occurrences in each year. By examining the relationship between rainfall patterns and flood events, we aim to develop predictive models that can anticipate future flood occurrences based on historical data.

This project holds significant implications for disaster management, urban planning, and infrastructure development in Kerala. By understanding the dynamics of rainfall and flood occurrences, policymakers and stakeholders can implement proactive measures to mitigate the impact of floods and enhance the resilience of communities in the region.

In summary, this project serves as a comprehensive exploration of Kerala's historical rainfall data, aiming to uncover insights that contribute to more effective flood prediction and disaster preparedness strategies. Through data-driven analysis and modeling, we endeavor to empower decision-makers with the knowledge needed to build a more resilient and sustainable future for Kerala.

FEATURES
Subdivision: Kerala

Year: Data spanning from 1901 to 2018 to cover over a century of monsoon seasons.

Monthly Rainfall: Total rainfall in millimeters for each month within the year.

Annual Rainfall: Summary of total rainfall for each year.

Flood Occurrence: A binary indicator denoting whether a flood occurred in a given year.

CONCLUSION
the model created is showing high accuracy in almost all evaluation matrices in which precision score is showing 1 , which is with the perfect accuracy

An AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) IN flood prediction project indicates a perfect performance in differentiating flood and non-flood events. This is a very positive outcome, but it's important to interpret it cautiously and consider some additional factors

Excellent Model Performance: An AUC suggests THE model can flawlessly distinguish between years with and without floods based on the features used. This is an ideal scenario and signifies a highly accurate model in predicting floods.
High Confidence in Predictions: With a perfect AUC, WE can be very confident in the model's ability to classify new data points (years) as flood or non-flood events.
